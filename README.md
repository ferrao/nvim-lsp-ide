# NeoVim IDE

This repo tracks my attempt and building a new IDE setup with neovim and LSP entirely configured
with the Lua programming language.

It is still a work in progress and not yet in a state that I can use to entirely replace [my existing
setup](https://github.com/ferrao/laptop-dot-files/tree/master/e14/config/nvim)
